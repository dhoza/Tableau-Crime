# Tableau-Crime
The Marshall Project set out to document crimes on the FBI violent crimes list (assaults,homicides,rapes, and robberies) in 69 police jurisdictions that have a population greater than or equal to 250,000 from 1975 to 2015. Dataset was retreived from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/marshallproject/crime-rates) in March 2021.

"The crime data was acquired from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program's "Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest" database for the year in question, held at the National Archives of Criminal Justice Data. The data was compiled and analyzed by Gabriel Dance, Tom Meagher, and Emily Hopkins of The Marshall Project; the analysis was published as Crime in Context on 18 August 2016." (Kaggle.com)

The Crimes per Year chart shows that crime is on a downward trend since the mid 1990s. Some reasons for this may be that incarceration was privatized in the 1980s and by the early 1990s, the tough on crime policies focused on crack cocaine. Police force was increased which led to increased incarceration.
